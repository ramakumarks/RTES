1. Use command "chmod +x build.sh to make the bash script executable.
2. Run the command "sudo ./build.sh" to create a folder named build and build using ninja.
3.Copy the image file named 'zephyr.strip' from the path /build/zephyr to the folder named 'kernel' in SD card.
4.To initiate the measurements type following commands in shell:
	-To measure the context switching overhead type the commands inside the quotes: "measure 1".
	-To measure the interrupt latency without background computing type the commands inside the quotes: "measure 2"
	-To measure the interrupt latency with background computing type the commands inside the quotes: "measure 3"
5.Digital Pin 7 of Galileo generates output signals and Pin 2 is interrupt enabled for rising edge.
=============================
NOTE:
-Source the project environment file to set the project environtment variables in zephyre project folder:
source zephyr-env.sh
-Make sure your environment is setup by exporting the following environment variables.
